\maketitle
In this workshop, we explore the theme of roots, coefficients, and symmetry.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let
\[ p(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4,\]
and let \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in \mathbf{C}\) be the roots of \(p(x)\).
The expression
\[ \alpha^2 + \beta^2 + \gamma^{2}\]
is symmetric, and hence must be rational.
Find out the exact value.

\item If an expression is not completely symmetric, the more symmetric it is, the ``closer'' it is to the base field.
For example, let \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\) be the roots (in some big extension) of a cubic \(p(x) \in F[x]\).
Prove that \(\alpha^2 \beta + \beta^2 \gamma + \gamma^2\alpha\) has degree at most 2 over \(F\).\\
\emph{Hint}: Following the idea in the proof of the theorem about splitting fields, try to construct a symmetric polynomial of degree 2 with this as a root.

\item As another application of the principle above, let \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta\) be the roots (in some extension) of a quartic over \(F\).
Prove that
\[ \alpha\beta + \gamma\delta\]
has degree at most 3 over \(F\).

\item As another application of the principle, let \(\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_n\) be the roots of \(p(x) \in F[x]\) of degree \(n\).
Consider
\[ d = \prod_{i < j}(\alpha_i - \alpha_j).\]
Prove that \(d\) satisfies a quadratic equation over \(F\).

\item Sometimes, the element is closer to the base-field than we expect from symmetry.
For example, consider the cubic
\[ p(x) = x^3-3x-1.\]
Prove that for this cubic, the element \(d\) above is actually a rational number.
You may find it helpful to consult Wikipedia for the formula for the discriminant of a cubic.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Solutions}
\label{sec:org647b5cd}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We write \(\alpha^2+\beta^2+\gamma^2\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials:
\[ \alpha^2+\beta^2+\gamma^2 = (\alpha+\beta+\gamma)^2-2(\alpha\beta+\alpha\gamma+\beta\gamma).\]
So this is equal to \((-2)^2-6 = -2.\)

\item Let
\[ \eta_1 = \alpha^2 \beta + \beta^2 \gamma + \gamma^2\alpha\]
and
\[ \eta_2 = \alpha \beta^2 + \beta \gamma^2 + \gamma\alpha^{2}.\]
Observe that \(\{\eta_1,\eta_2\}\) form one orbit under permutations of \(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\).
The quadratic polynomial
\[(x-\eta_1)(x-\eta_2)\]
is symmetric under any permutation of \(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\), and hence its coefficients must lie in \(F\).

\item Same idea as above.
This time the orbit consists of 3 elements.

\item Same idea as above.
This time the orbit consists of 2 elements and they are \(\pm d\).
So the quadratic is actually quite simple: \[x^2-d^2 = 0.\]
Notice that \(d^2\) is the discriminant.
So \(d\) is a square-root of the discriminant.

\item The discriminant \(\Delta\) of
\[ x^3+ax+b\]
is
\[ \Delta = -4a^3-27b^2.\]
In this case, it is \(\Delta = 108-27 = 81\) so \(d = \pm 9\).
\end{enumerate}
